To compile and install the program, cd to the rrabbit
directory created when you unzipped the archive and type:

make
make clean

You can then run the program by typing

./rrabbit

If you want to have the software where everyone can get hold of
it and share high scores, as root type

make install

then you can run the program as rrabbit.

The "make install" creates the link /usr/bin/rrabbit which points
to /usr/games/rrabbit/rrabbit, so to run the program, simply
type "rrabbit" at a command prompt or create a shortcut to
it. This assumes that /usr/bin is in your PATH variable.

The program does require wxWindows to be installed. You will
need the Run Time libraries to run it, and the Development
libraries to compile it. These can be found at

www.wxwindows.org

I can be contacted at rich@ricksoft.co.uk, but do not
guarantee to reply to any emails, including bug reports.

There is a help file (RRabbit.htm) which explains how to play

Enjoy the mayhem!

If anyone wants to create a binary for Windows(R) I would be willing
to place it on my website with appropriate credits.

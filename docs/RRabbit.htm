<p>You are the Rabid Rabbit. Turned into a offensive arsenal after being bitten by a radioactive sheep dog, you now take over its job and try to collect the sheep, avoiding and killing anything that tries to eat you on the way.</p>
<p><font color="DARK GREEN" size="+2"><i>How do I move?</i></font></p>
<p>Click the board using the left mouse button and you'll move towards that point. Click the middle mouse button to stop.</p>
<p><font color="DARK GREEN" size="+2"><i>How do I shoot?</i></font></p>
<p>Everyone always asks this. You start firing by right clicking in the direction you want to fire. You will continue to fire in that direction, but be warned you will also begin to move in that direction. Once firing has begun, nothing will stop it. Except finishing the level, being killed or a power cut.</p>
<p><font color="DARK GREEN" size="+2"><i>You mentioned something about sheep?</i></font></p>
<p>There are five sheep moving around in each level. Moving over them will pick them up and save the day! If you get all five, a bonus item will appear somewhere in the playing area. Move over it to get the bonus.</p>
<p><font color="DARK GREEN" size="+2"><i>What types of bonuses are there?</i></font></p>
<table width="500">
<tr><td width="150" align="center"><img src="bonus.gif"></td><td>Extra points-"just what it says on the tin"</td></tr>
<tr><td width="150" align="center"><img src="bomb.gif"></td><td>Bomb-kills all bad guys on this level. You don't score highly if you use this-but it may save your life</td></tr>
<tr><td width="150" align="center"><img src="power.gif"></td><td>Power up-makes the bullets more powerful</td></tr>
<tr><td width="150" align="center"><img src="unkill.gif"></td><td>Invulnerability-for a limited time you are impervious to everything</td></tr>
<tr><td width="150" align="center"><img src="heart.gif"></td><td>Extra Life-"just what it says on the tin"</td></tr>
</table>

<p><font color="DARK GREEN" size="+2"><i>So how do I get killed?</i></font></p>
<p>Hitting anything that isn't a sheep or bonus will lose you a life. Needless to say, the level starts again. Oh, and you can lose a bit of power in the bullets each time you get killed as well. Not recommended if you want to finish the game.</p>
<p><font color="DARK GREEN" size="+2"><i>How do I complete a level?</i></font></p>
<p>Make sure there is nothing moving except you and your bullets. Which means collecting all the sheep, killing all the bad guys and collecting any bonuses you get. Simple really.</p>
<p><font color="DARK GREEN" size="+2"><i>Hints:</i></font></p>
<ul>
<li>Try to stay near the outside of the area (at least for the lower levels...)</li>
<li>Worry about survival, not sheep collection</li>
<li>Practise moving away from the things you are firing at (coz they come after you...)</li>
<li>If you see an Invulnerability Power up, (eg level 4) GET IT QUICK. You will almost certainly need it!</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="DARK GREEN" size="+2"><i>I am indebted to:</i></font></p>
<p>Someone whose name I can't remember. He wrote a program similar to this for the Atari ST, and I loved it so much I thought I'd clone the concepts. His version had many more levels, joystick control, incredible sound and ran on a really slow computer at a fantastic speed.
I have tried to keep the flavour of the game, but can't even remember what it was called.
You know who you are. If you ever read this, feel free to contact me.
You gave me many hours of pleasure as a spotty teenager.</p>
<p><font color="DARK GREEN" size="+2"><i>Software Requirements:</i></font></p>
<p>For the program to run, you will need to have wxWindows run-time support loaded. This can be downloaded (free) from <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org">www.wxwindows.org</A>
(Link is correct Feb 2017)</p>
<p><font color="DARK GREEN" size="+2"><i>Technical Stuff you don't need to know:</i></font></p>
<p>The software was written completely in C++ and compiled using the GNU compiler "g++".</p>
<p>The creature classes are in "creatures.cpp", and the game class is in "rgame.cpp". Headers for these are in the equivalent .h files and
the GUI and game control is in "rrabbit.cpp".</p>
<p>The GUI was programmed using wxWindows 3.0.2, a cross platform set of libraries, so you should be able to compile it for Windows (I haven't yet).
 The latest development took place on a Linux Mint 17 platform.</p>
